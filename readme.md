****hide****:--   You can hide an element in CSS using the CSS properties 

            display: none; 
            (display: none removes the entire element from the page and mat affect the layout of the page.)




# JAVASCRIPT

- 1)**querySelector** :--The querySelector() method returns the first element that matches a CSS selector.
- 2)**addEventListener()** :--The addEventListener() method allows you to add event listeners on any HTML DOM 
                        object such as HTML elements, the HTML document, the window object, or other objects that support events, like the xmlHttpRequest object.

- 3)**keydown event**:--This event is fired when a key is pressed. When you hold down the key without releasing, 
                  it fires repeatedly.

- 4)**keyup event**:--This event is fired when you release the key that was pressed.

- 5)**event.code(e.code)**:--This represents a physical key on the keyboard. It also tells us which side of 
                       the key was pressed (leftMeta/rightMeta/ leftAltâ€¦).

- 6)**event.key(e.key)**:--This is the string representation of a key pressed by the user. Modifier keys, 
                     such as Shift,   are also considered. For example, if j is pressed on the keyboard,
                     then j will be returned, and if Shift + j is pressed, then J will be returned.


- 7)***window.requestAnimationFrame(step);*** :---The window.requestAnimationFrame() method tells the browser
                                          that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser calls a specified function to 
                                          update an animation before the next repaint.


- 8) ***getBoundingClientRect()*** :-- The getBoundingClientRect() method returns the size of an element 
                                       and its position relative to the viewport.

                                       The getBoundingClientRect() method returns a DOMRect object with eight properties: left, top, right, bottom, x, y, width, height.
